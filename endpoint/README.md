# Project Lego API Documentation

Our team utilizes both REST API authentication and GraphQL, with REST being our primary method for authenticating user requests and GraphQL serving as our primary query language for accessing and manipulating data from our server. This allows us to leverage the strengths of both technologies in order to provide a secure and efficient experience for our users.
