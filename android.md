# Project Lego Android

## Technical Documentation

### GETTING STARTED

Project Lego Android was developed using Android Studio. This project uses Kotlin as the Programming Language, Android Studio Layout Editor for the Interface, and Gradle for connecting different Third-Party Libraries. The target and compiled SDK Version is 30 with a minimum SDK version of 26.
For more information on the IDE and system requirements to enable you to work on the source code, it is available [here](https://developer.android.com/)

### INSTALLATION AND DEVELOPMENT

In order to start the development, first you need to start Android Studio. Import the Project Lego project and then wait for the build to finish.

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Project Lego Android uses Kotlin for development

### MINIMUM VERSION

Project Lego can run on Android Systems with minimum SDK version 26. It may encounter multiple issues on lower SDKversions.

### APPLICATION ID

com.robinsonslandcorp.projectlego

### DEBUGGING

We use a few debugging tools to test Project Lego functionalities.
We also use Android Virtual Device in Android Studio in order to test the Native Apps in different screen sizes and SDK Versions. 

### THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES

Most of the third-party libraries are integrated using Gradle. They can be added by searching library names found in the Dependencies tab in the Project Structure window.

##### Important Libraries

### ARCHITECTURE USED

Project Lego Android follows and uses the Model-View-ViewModel Architecture (MVVM). It consists of a Composable file which is the UI layout definition for the screen, a NavController that is the UI controller that navigates and displays the data, and the ViewModel, a class that prepares the data for viewing in the Composables and reacts to user interactions.
